%
%  projectOptions is a nullary function which initialises a struct
%  containing the preferences and details for a particular project.
%  It should be edited to taste before a project is run, and a new
%  one created for each substantially different project (though the
%  options struct will be saved each time the project is run under
%  a new name, so all will not be lost if you don't do this).
%
%  For a guide to how to fill out the fields in this file, consult
%  the documentation folder (particularly the userOptions_guide.m)
